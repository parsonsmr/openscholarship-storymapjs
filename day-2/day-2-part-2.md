## Day 2, Part 2 (in progress)
Welcome to Part 2! This part will give an overview of the data visualization assignment for this week as well as go over the tool that we'll be using to create visualizations. Before starting your visualization, check out the tips from Day 1, Part 2

### Datawrapper
The visualization tool for this week is **Datawrapper**. It is a non-commercial, open source software that does not require you to install anything on your device (it runs using most browsers). While Datawrapper does not have the same capabilities to create highly complex visualizations (such as Excel or Tableau), it allows for some customization and has a gentler learning curve than other tools. 

#### Creating an account
Although you do not *need* to create a Datawrapper account, you will not be able to edit any visualizations in the future unless you have an account. Follow the steps to [create an account](https://app.datawrapper.de/signin "create an account") if you would like to save your visualizations. 

#### Getting started
From the [Datawrapper homepage](https://www.datawrapper.de/ "Datawrapper homepage"), click on [Start creating](https://app.datawrapper.de/chart/create "Start creating") to begin.
