## Day 1, Part 1 (in progress)
Welcome to Day 1 of the session! Today, we'll be covering: 
* What is data? What is data visualization?
* Types of data
* Why visualize?
* Chart types
* Design principles
* Basic math
* Sketching/planning a visualization
* Data storytelling

Before you get started, head over to the [discussion post to introduce yourself!](https://github.com/negeenaghassi/osssdv/discussions/2 "discussion post to introduce yourself!")

If you run into any issues using GitHub or have any other questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at negeena@uw.edu. 

## What is data? 
To get started, we'll begin at the foundation: defining data. There are endless ways to phrase what data are, but a simple way of thinking about it is that data are pieces of information that, when combined and analyzed, describe that information.

Some examples of data might include:
* Recorded temperature over time
* Number and titles of books in a library
* Number of pens you lose in a year
* Interviews with UW students in a research study 
* Latitude and longitude of your favorite restaurants in Washington 
* Census records
* Answers to a user survey 

Data can be composed of digital and analog records, can be quantitative, qualitative, or geospatial, and so on. It might exist in spreadsheet software or on the back of a napkin. You likely come across data everyday, even if it's not always remarkable! 
## What is data visualization? 
Data visualization takes data and presents it in a graphical form. Data visualizations can be created by specific software, digital technologies, or even by hand. Below are some examples of data visualizations. 

For a glossary of data visualization-related terms, please refer to the [data visualization guide](https://guides.lib.uw.edu/datavisualization/glossary "data visualization guide").
