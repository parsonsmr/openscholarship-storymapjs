Welcome to Day 3, Part 2! This part will look at potential solutions to some of the issues raised in Part 1 and review concrete examples of steps to take in visualization practices to be more inclusive. 

In Part 1, the ways in which data structures oversimplify identities was a major theme in framing how data can exclude and harm people and communities. 

However, we often do not have a choice in the structures that we use: for example, local government surveys may need to use the US Census definitions in order to be able to benchmark or because of policy requirements. 

In these situations, there are still steps that can be taken to be more inclusive: 
* *Collaborate* with others to include multiple perspectives
* *Be transparent* in the decisions that you make when you collect, analyze, and visualize the data
* *Put care* into how you speak about and represent the people who have contributed to your data
* *Share data with the community* that you are working with along the way

### Data is not neutral
All of this information leads to the conclusion that data is not neutral. Each of the steps taken to develop a visualization includes decisions that can be built from biases and be harmful. Below are some questions to consider asking when creating a visualization. 

#### Questions to ask when selecting a topic
* Why are you selecting this topic? 
* Who will benefit from your work on this topic and who will not? 
* Will anyone be harmed by your selection of this topic? 
* Are you working with data and information that is not yours? 
* Are you the right person to be conducting this research, collecting this data, and creating this visualization? 

#### Questions to ask when getting the data
* Who collected the data and how? 
* What were their biases and how did they impact the data collection process? 
* Who has control over the data, and who does the data belong to? 
* Are the answers to that question in conflict with one another? 
* Who performed the labor to gather that data? Was it community members, government workers, graduate workers, etc.? 

#### Questions to ask when cleaning the data
* Who cleaned the data? 
* How did they clean the data? 
* Did they document the decisions they made when cleaning the data? 
* Who has been made invisible or erased in the data? 
* Who has been prioritized in the data?
