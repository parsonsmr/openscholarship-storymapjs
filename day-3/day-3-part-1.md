## Day 3, Part 1
Welcome to Day 3! Today's focus is going to be on data visualization and inclusion and accessibility. A visualization is not useful if it is not accessible by readers and can be harmful when it is not inclusive and reinforces biases. 

To begin to frame this topic, the following quote by Giorgia Lupi (co-creator of the *Dear Data* series that was excerpted in Day 1) helps lay out the ways in which data are more than just pieces of information: 

*“Data represents real life. It is a snapshot of the world, in the same way that a picture catches a small moment in time. Numbers are always placeholders for something else, a way to capture a point of view — but sometimes this can get lost. Failing to represent these limitations and nuances and blindly putting numbers in a chart is like reviewing a movie by analyzing the chemical properties of the cellulose on which the images were recorded.”*

* Giorgia Lupi, [“Data Humanism, the Revolution will be Visualized”](http://giorgialupi.com/data-humanism-my-manifesto-for-a-new-data-wold "Data Humanism, the Revolution will be Visualized") 

Data represent real people, places, and things -- it is a proxy for real life. 

However, when we work with data, we often abstract it further and further away from real life. Language such as:
* wrangle
* clean
* prepare
* normalize
* tidy

indicates the methods that are used that, in the effort to make data easier to process, creates a bigger gap between the data points and the people behind them. 

Let's look at an example: 

* Person A fills out a Census survey and their response in the race section is that they are white.
* However, if you had asked the person to fill out a short answer question about their race, they would have identified as Iranian, ethnically Persian. This is a very different answer than the single choice option provided in the Census. 

When we look at how the United States defines race, we see that “white” actually comprises of large groups of people who likely have different lived experiences, bodies, and histories. 

According to the US government, there are a few specific racial categories, a category for 2 or more races (though it often does not matter which 2 or more races), and an "other" category. Given the complexity of how to define race, it is difficult to see how only a few categories of race are sufficient to capture the full identities of people. This oversimplification of racial data makes it very easy for computers to process and for analyzers to make comparisons and for those in power to make decisions based on the supposedly objective data (where there are no other answers and everything fits cleanly into these categories). However, what this does is fail to recognize the full depth of individual histories and identities.

Let's say that we decide that we'll just expand our categories -- a good example of this is Statistics Canada, which has many more categories. It’s more in depth, but still, this approach strips away some pieces of that person’s identity so that they are easier for a computer to process.
