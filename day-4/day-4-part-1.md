## Day 4, Part 1
### Accessibility
While equity, diversity, and inclusion have become increasingly more common in discussions about data visualization, accessibility is another critical element that deserves to be addressed as well. Accessibility sits at the foundation of inclusive data visualization design and is not an option or feature that can be turned on or off. While there are no formal around creating accessible data visualizations in the same way that there are for general web design, it can be helpful to make progress, even if not perfect. 

One of the guiding principles of this work is universal design -- designing for everyone regardless of disability. The comic below depicts a person in a wheelchair who says, “Could you please shovel the ramp?” A person shoveling some stairs responds, “All these other kids are waiting to use the stairs. When I get through shoveling them off, then I will clear the ramp for you.” The person in the wheelchair responds, “But if you shovel the ramp, we can all get in!”

This comic demonstrates how universal design is beneficial for all. This approach to data visualization can help make visualizations more accessible for all.
