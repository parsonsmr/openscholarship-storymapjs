## Day 5
Congratulations on making it to Day 5! I hope this sesion has been helpful and that you have some tools that you can continue to use as you learn more about data visualization. 
The goal of today is to wrap up, ask any remaining questions in the [ongoing discussion post](https://github.com/negeenaghassi/openscholarship-dataviz/discussions/8 "ongoing discussion post") or directly to me, and share out your visualizations. 

If your visualization is still a draft, don't worry! Feel free to share it with the cohort if you are comfortable. 

### Sharing your visualization
In order to share your visualization *while logged in to your Datawrapper account*, follow these steps: 

1. In Datawrapper, navigate to the **Publish & Embed** arrow of your visualization.

3. Copy and paste the link to your visualization and answer the other questions in the [Day 5 Discussion](https://github.com/negeenaghassi/openscholarship-dataviz/discussions/6 "Day 5 Discussion").

**If you do not have a Datawrapper account,** feel free to take a screenshot of your visualization and attach the image to your post in the [Day 5 Discussion](https://github.com/negeenaghassi/openscholarship-dataviz/discussions/6 "Day 5 Discussion").
