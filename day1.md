## What is data? 
To get started, we'll begin at the foundation: defining data. There are endless ways to phrase what data are, but a simple way of thinking about it is that data are pieces of information that, when combined and analyzed, describe that information.

Some examples of data might include:
* Recorded temperature over time
* Number and titles of books in a library
* Number of pens you lose in a year
* Interviews with UW students in a research study 
* Latitude and longitude of your favorite restaurants in Washington 
* Census records
* Answers to a user survey 

Data can be composed of digital and analog records, can be quantitative, qualitative, or geospatial, and so on. You likely come across data everyday, even if it's not always remarkable! 
## What is data visualization? 
Data visualization takes data and presents it in a graphical form. Data visualizations can be created by specific software, digital technologies, or even by hand. Below are some examples of data visualizations.
